# Principles

Modern UI design has evolved with larger, high-resolution screens, adopting principles from editorial design such as negative space and typographic hierarchy. This trend has led to interfaces that hide supposedly unnecessary elements behind menus through progressive disclosure, creating visually simpler screens.

However, creative professionals require different UI principles. Unlike end users, they need to manipulate numerous parameters of various types simultaneously and repeatedly. Creative software functions more like a musical instrument -- a tool that users invest time in learning and embodying over extended periods.　Rather than prioritizing so-called “intuitive” or “easy-to-use” interfaces, we need new principles based on the assumption that users will develop muscle memory and expertise over time. These principles should enable higher speed and precision through learned proficiency, acknowledging that creative tools benefit from interfaces optimized for mastery rather than immediate accessibility.

The design principles of Tweeq articulated below define the essential qualities that GUI should embody for creative professionals rather than end users. These principles guide the development of interfaces that support efficiency and flexibility in their creative workflows.

### Adaptive Control Scaling

_Users should have fine control over how much a parameter changes per input action._

### Input Parallelization & Serialization

_Users should be able to increase or decrease the degree of integration[^1] in their input actions._

### Relative & Absolute Adjustments

_Users should be able to manipulate parameters both relatively and absolutely._

### Gestural & Digital Inputs

_Users should be able to control parameters both through continuous gestural inputs and discrete digital inputs._

### Maximizing Screen Real Estate Efficiency

_UI should prioritize parameter visibility and density rather visual simplicity._

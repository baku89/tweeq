# Principles

Modern UI design has evolved with larger and high-resolution screens, while adopting editorial design concepts such as negative space and typographic hierarchy. This trend has led to interfaces that hide supposedly unnecessary elements behind menus through progressive disclosure, creating visually simpler screens.

However, creative professionals require different nature of UI. Unlike end users, they need to manipulate numerous paramete of various types simultaneously and repeatedly. Creative software functions more like a musical instrument -- a tool that users invest time in learning and embodying over extended periods.

Therefore, rather than prioritizing so-called “intuitive” or “easy-to-use” interfaces, we need new rules based on the assumption that users will develop muscle memory and expertise over time.

The design principles of Tweeq articulated below define the essential qualities that GUI should embody for creative professionals rather than end users. These principles guide the development of interfaces that support serendipity, flexibility, and a high degree of exploratory freedom within the parameter space in creative workflows.

### Adaptive Control Scaling

_Users should have fine control over how much a parameter changes per input action._

 - Press `Shift` and `Option` keys to multiply the speed of a parameter change on drag by 10x or 0.1x.
 - Swipe up and down on a numeric slider to change seek rate on touch devices.

### Input Parallelization & Serialization

_Users should be able to control multiple parameters simultaneously or focus on manipulating a single parameter individually._

 - Dragging a 3D gizmo allows movement along multiple axes, while holding Shift constrains it to one axis.
 - Pinch-to-zoom and rotate in viewport enables simultaneous scaling and rotation in design software.

### Relative & Absolute Adjustments

_Users should be able to manipulate parameters both relatively and absolutely._

 - Dragging a handle on a slider changes the parameter value relative to the current value, while clicking on the slider itself sets the value absolutely.
 - Typing `value + 10` or `value - 5` into an input field incrementally shifts the current value, while entering a specific number overrides it absolutely.

### Continuous & Discrete Controls

_Users should be able to control parameters both through continuous gestural inputs and discrete digital inputs._

 - Dragging on a corner of bounding box to rotate a shape continuously, while dragging with pressing `Shift` key constrains it to 45 degree increments.
 - Using a MIDI controller to control volume continuously vs. setting exact dB values in a numerical input field.

### Screen Space Efficiency

_UI should prioritize parameter visibility and density rather visual simplicity._

 -  Instead of placing a slider and a numeric input field side by side, a single clickable slider allows direct number input when clicked.
 -  Eliminating exessive negative space by reducing margins or padding between UI elements.

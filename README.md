# Tweeq

Tweeq is a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)-based UI component library for design tools. The components range from fundamental UIs such as numeric sliders, color pickers, to advanced and niche controls like a cubic-bezier editor. It also supports various micro-interactions suitable for professional use.

It is continuously developed by the visual artist [Baku Hashimoto](https://baku89.com), who adopts the stance of starting his own production from tool development. Originally developed for [Glisp](https://github.com/baku89/glisp).
